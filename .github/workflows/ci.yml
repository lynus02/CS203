# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop, test ]  # Runs on push to main or develop branches
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]           # Runs on any PR targeting the main branch

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # These are the steps that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code from the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the correct version of Java
      - name: Set up JDK 21
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '21'
          distribution: 'temurin' # Popular distribution from Eclipse
          cache: 'maven' # This caches Maven dependencies to speed up future runs

      # Step 3: Build the project, run tests, and ensure packaging works.
      # The `-B` flag runs in batch mode (non-interactive). The `verify` goal is standard for CI.
